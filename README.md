# **Algorithm concepts**
This a course under freecodecamp where we dive into algorithm that are finite or determine sequences of explicit instructions that are used to solve problems
---
## Objectives
The objective here is to equip myself with using a well defined formal language in this case :snake: to calculate functions
---
### Foundational principles of algorithms
1. Input
2. Instructions
3. Execution : execution of those sets of instructions step by step leading to 
4. Output : that ends in termination of the program.

# Types of Algorithms we looking into
1. Simple Recursive Algorithms
2. Algorithms within data structures
3. Divide and conquer
4. Greedy Algorithms
5. Dynamic Programming
